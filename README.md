AI-Powered Workout Planner Workout Plan Generation based on medical history

AI-Powered Workout Planner
This application is an intelligent agent that generates a personalized workout plan and evaluates it for safety based on a user's medical history. It leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and external search tools to provide a comprehensive and reliable fitness recommendation.

Features
Workout Plan Generation: The agent performs a direct internet search to create a detailed, 4-week workout routine tailored to your request (e.g., muscle gain, weight loss, specific equipment).

Medical Safety Evaluation: It takes an optional medical history and performs an additional search to evaluate the generated plan for any potential risks or conflicts.

Suggested Alternatives: If an exercise is found to be unsafe, the agent suggests a safe, alternative exercise that targets the same muscle group.

Intuitive Interface: A user-friendly Gradio interface allows for easy input and displays the final workout plan and safety analysis.
